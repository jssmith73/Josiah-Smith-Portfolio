# Josiah Smith Portfolio

## Description

https://jssmith73.github.io/Josiah-Smith-Portfolio/

This repo acts as an ongoing portfolio project to reflect my previous work to potential employers.

I use this repo to store links of my bootcamp projects as well as provide information about myself and methods of contact.

While making this repo I experimented and learned a lot with CSS postioning and flexbox.
